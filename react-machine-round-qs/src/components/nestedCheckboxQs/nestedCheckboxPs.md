# Nested Checkbox Problem statement
**Follow up-1**: Generate a recursively nested structure based on a given configuration
**Follow-up 2**: If all child checkboxes are selected, the parent checkbox should automatically be checked.
**Follow-up 3**: If the parent checkbox is selected, all child checkboxes should also be selected.
This problem tests your understanding of DOM manipulation, event propagation, and depth-first search (DFS).
<!-- I solved it using two DFS traversals. -->
